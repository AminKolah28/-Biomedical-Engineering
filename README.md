EEG Signal Analysis and Bio-Signal Amplifier Design
This project encompasses two key aspects: EEG signal analysis and the design of bio-signal amplifiers for ECG and EEG signals.

EEG Signal Analysis: In the first part of the project, we explore the fundamentals of EEG analysis. EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. The data is loaded, analyzed, and visualized in both time and frequency domains. Key tasks include:

Signal Visualization: Plotting selected EEG signal channels in time and frequency domains.
Frequency Analysis: Using Fourier Transform to investigate brainwave frequencies (alpha, beta, delta, theta, and gamma). Additionally, reconstructing signals via inverse Fourier transform and identifying abnormalities in the signals.
Sleep Stage Analysis: Studying different sleep stages by analyzing EEG frequencies and reporting on the power of various frequency bands across these stages.
Bio-Signal Amplifier Design: The second part focuses on the design of amplifiers for ECG and EEG signals, which are essential for signal acquisition and processing in medical applications. Using software like NI Multisim, the project entails:

ECG Amplifier: Designing an adjustable gain amplifier (1000-5000) with a bandwidth of 0.1-100 Hz and an input impedance of ≥1 MΩ. The design must handle noise interference, including 50 Hz power line noise and high-frequency noise, and may incorporate summing amplifiers and notch filters for noise elimination.
EEG Amplifier: Creating an amplifier with a gain of 10,000-50,000, a bandwidth of 0.1-200 Hz, and an input impedance ≥5 MΩ. The focus is on maintaining signal integrity while eliminating high-frequency and power line noise, which can interfere with EEG signals.
This combined project highlights both the analysis of EEG signals and the practical challenges of amplifying bio-signals for accurate medical diagnostics.
